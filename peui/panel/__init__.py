Table 11.1  The predefined sizers in wxPython

Sizer Type          Description

Grid        A very basic grid layout.  Best used when the widgets you are placing are
            all exactly the same size and neatly fall into a regular grid.

Flex Grid   A slight change from the grid sizer, allowing better results when the widgets
            are different sizes.

Grid Bag    The most flexible member of the grid sizer family, allowing for more arbitrary placement


Box         Either a horizontal or vertical box with widgets laid out in a line.  Very flexible in controlling


Static Box  A standard box sizer with a line and a title around it.
